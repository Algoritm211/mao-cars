**THIS...** is a 2002 BMW 530i Sedan. Finished in Titanium Gray Metallic with a black interior.

- The attached Carfax history report contains some gaps, though it indicates no accidents or mileage discrepancies for the given period; it also shows registration to one owner in California since new.
- According to the window sticker provided in the gallery, factory equipment includes the Premium and Sport Packages, xenon headlights, fog lights, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. The selling dealer reports no modifications.
- Called E39 internally, the fourth-generation 5 Series debuted for the 1997 model year. It wore a more modern design than its predecessor, and it received aluminum suspension components to keep weight in check. The 530i replaced the 528i for 2001 as a mid-range model positioned between the 525i and the V8-powered 540i.
- Power comes from a 3.0-liter straight-6, rated at 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Output is sent to the rear wheels via a 5-speed automatic transmission.
